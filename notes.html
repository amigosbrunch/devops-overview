- initialzise git repo  # git init (cd /path/to/repo)
- make a change         # (make a file or add anything in it)
- staging the change    # git add . (or git add index.html)
- commit the change     # git commit -m "index page is added"
- add data              # git add.  
                        # git commit -m "index file modified"


- remove changes in staging     # git add. 
                                # git restore --staged hello.txt (removes hello from staging) 
                                # git commit -m "only index mod is added"
- look into project history     # git log (we can prettify the log by changing this command)
- add more commits              # git diff d3f599b726b3d6c237c7e5bdf15c2375491bd466 
                                  (shows the difference when the commit added)
- remove a commit from project  # git reset --hard d3f599b726b3d6c237c7e5bdf15c2375491bd466


- start github                  # (login to github)
- connecting github to git              
    (Check Git Installation)
        # git --version  
    
    (Set Up Git (If Not Configured))
        # git config --global user.name "YourGitHubUsername"  
        # git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

    (Press Enter to save it in the default location.)
        # ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"

    (Start SSH Agent and Add Key)
        # eval $(ssh-agent -s)
        # ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    (Copy the SSH Key to GitHub)
        # cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
            [Copy the output and add it to GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH Key]

    (Test Connection)
        # ssh -T git@github.com
            
- create new repo in github             # create a repo(ex:- devops-overview) in github.com
- connect remote repo to local repo     
    (push an existing repository from the command line)
        # git remote add origin https://github.com/amigosbrunch/devops-overview.git 
        # git remote -v 
            (to check connection added)
        # git push 
            (for fist time: # git push --set-upstream origin master)

- make a change commit and push it to remote repo            
        # git add .
            (after the change)
        # git commit -m "new line added"
        # git push

- host a live page in github (if repo is public)
    - go to settings > branch: master | folder: root > save 
        (wait for sometime, link will appear the of the page)


- add README.md (ref: readme.so)
    - add a basic template to explain your repo

- explore other version control apps (ex:- git lab)
    - login https://gitlab.com/
    - create a new project > create a blank project(ex:- devops-gitlab) > 
    - set origin for local code here
        # git remote add gl-origin git@gitlab.com:amigosbrunch/devops-gitlab.git
            (as previously we have done - connecting github to git)
        # git remote -v 
            (to check connection added)
        # git push 
            (for fist time: # git push --set-upstream gl-origin master)
    - add ssh key
        # cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
            - Copy the output and add it to gitlab > profile > ssh key > paste it here > add key   
                # ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@example.com"
                # eval $(ssh-agent -s)
                # ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
                # cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
                    [run the above commands if not ran before]
    - push code
        # git push gl-origin master


- git branches      
    # git branch -a (response: greens are branhes accessed in local)

- making a new branch and switching to it
    # git branch -a 
        (shows all branhes)
    # git branch feat-1 
        (clones the current head{updated log} of the master into it)
    # git switch feat-1 
        (switched to new branch)
(or)
    # git checkout -b feat-2 (new branch created and switched into it while clonng the master head log)
    # git checkout (shows the current branch)
    # git checkout feat-2 (switch to feat-2)

- pushing change of branch to remote
    # git checkout  or # git branch -a
        (shows current branch)
    # git add .
    # git commit -m "feat 1"
    # git push origin
    # git push 
        (for fist time: # git push --set-upstream origin master)

- pushing change of branch to remote
    # git checkout  or # git branch -a
        (shows current branch)
    # git add .
    # git commit -m "feat 1"
    # git push origin
    # git push 
        (for fist time: # git push --set-upstream origin master)

- pushing change of branch from remote to local
    - make some change in remote & commit on a branch
    - come to local and pull that branch
        # git checkout <target_branch_name>
        # git pull

- merging a branch to master locally
    # git switch master  or  # git checkout master
    # git merge <target_branch_name>
        (master branch changed
            git log: to see a new commit for merge is added)
    # git push

- merging a branch to master in live (github.com)
    - create pull request (a branch developer)
        - go to repo > pull request > new pull request > base: master <target_branch> compare: feat-3 <source_branch> > create pull request
                                                       > add some meaningful comment > create pull request

    - approves the pull request for merge (master branch developer)
        - go to repo > pull request (sees a pull request is created) 
            - click on the pull request > files changed (to look deeply into it, put review if necessary) 
            - go to conversation (open) > commit (resolve if any conflict or give a review and do not merge) > merge
            - can check the merge in code commits
